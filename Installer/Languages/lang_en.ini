; This INI file contains the translations for your language

; CREATING AND/OR IMPROVING A TRANSLATION
; Please replace the English strings with equivalents from your language. These follow
; this structure:
;
;    ItemKey = "ItemValue"
;
; You can pass quotation marks to this file so that they are properly interpreted by
; DISMTools by putting "{quot;}" in the value. Everything that expects a value passed,
; like the value of a variable, must be put as {0}, {1}..., and so on, since these will
; be interpreted by "String.Format"
;
; -- Section Reference
; The names of the sections are derived from the names of the form classes. For example,
; to create translations tailored to the ISO creator, a section called "ISOCreator"
; needs to be made. Common words (such as Yes, No, Cancel...) are placed in the Common
; section.
; --------------------
; -- User Guidelines
; Please refrain from renaming the item keys unless the codebase changes to
; reference the new name of the key. Also refrain from putting periods in the names
; of the keys.

; This information is important to determine what language it targets and who created
; and/or modified this translation. Feel free to add yourself to the author list of this
; language file if you contributed to improve it.
